Description             : A mapset where the maps get smaller as you go!

                          We set out to create a straightforward Boom wad where
                          the catch is simple. Each map is smaller in size
                          than the last map. The futher you go, the more your
                          skills will be tested until you're stuck in a box
                          BFGing for your life.

                          If this sounds like your thing, then what are you
                          waiting for? Download Embryo and get to slaughterin'!
